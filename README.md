# 2DGraphVisualizer

## WIP

The goal of this project is to develop a visual education tool that allows the user to create custon graphs (or select from pre-existing graphs) and then step through pre-made search and shortest path algorithms in real time and visually depict how each line of code affects graph traversal.

Supported search alorithms are Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Djikstra, and A*
